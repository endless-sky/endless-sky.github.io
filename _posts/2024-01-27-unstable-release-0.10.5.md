The newest version of Endless Sky, v0.10.5, is now live on both Steam and Github. The full list of changes is available in the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/v0.10.5/changelog).

We are also now live on GOG! Give a MASSIVE thanks to Hecter, quyykk, and Saugia for getting the game published on another storefront.
Heads up that the GOG version of the game is currently in 0.10.4. We'll get the 0.10.5 version of the game on a beta channel like we have on Steam shortly.

You can give another big thanks to TomHawkins, who made this amazing trailer for the game that can now be seen on our Steam and GOG store pages!

As with all major updates, there's a lot to get excited about, so here are some highlights.

Are you addicted to plugins? Do you have so many plugins installed that they go off the screen? Or are you a plugin creator who has a lot to say about your plugin in its description, but not enough room to say it? Well thanks to the efforts of @thewierdnut, the plugins panel now has the ability to scroll through its contents! No longer do you have to fear being unable to see every single plugin you have installed from within the game, or that you won't have enough space to describe your plugin. Now you have all the space you'll ever need.

Are you an avid asteroid miner? Thanks to Saugia, DoomKorath (aka Quantumshark), bene_dictator, and myself (Derpy Horse, aka Amazinite), asteroid miners now have a new set of tools at their disposal. Make use of dedicated mining lasers that increase the yield of asteroids you mine, or buy yourself a Sunder and two mining drones for the dedicated mining ship experience. Ever have a hard time chasing down flotsam after destroying an asteroid? Buy a tractor beam and watch as it captures the flotsam and pulls it toward you, requiring no effort on your part. Great for mining in slower ships.

Are you a pirate to the core? Well thanks to scallywags like beccabunny, bene_dictator , Halasham, Lake (aka Galaucus), DoomKorath, and Saugia, pirates now have a new place to call home in the south with a new region of pirate systems, home to the remnants of the Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim. Along with this new territory comes new ships of old designs and new weapons available only on pirate worlds. This is a taste of what these ‚Å†pirate-gameplay denizens have in store, as there are plans for more expansions to pirate regions and gameplay in the future.

All this and more is available in version 0.10.5 of the game! Remember to star the game on Github if you haven't already, and give the game a warm welcome on GOG with a 5 star review.

We also have a [feedback box](https://forms.gle/gPERzubizkhyeq6w8) for this release.

Friendly reminder that in order to play unstable updates on Steam or GOG, you will need to opt into the beta branch.
- On Steam, go to your library, right click Endless Sky, go to Properties, go to Betas, and select the beta in the drop down box. (You don't need any sort of beta code, just select beta in the drop down box and close the menu.)
- On GOG, go to your library, right click Endless Sky, go to Manage Installation -> Configure, and select the beta in the Beta Channels drop down box.

The next release, v0.10.6, will be a stable release that focuses on bug fixes for the past major release. You will not need to opt into the beta branch on Steam or GOG when it is made available. The plan is to have this bug fix release finished by the end of February.
