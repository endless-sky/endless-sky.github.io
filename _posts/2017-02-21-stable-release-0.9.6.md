A new release is now available on GitHub, stable version 0.9.6. This version focuses on bug fixes and small, safe changes to the code. Downloads are available for [Mac OS X](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.6/endless-sky-macosx-0.9.6.dmg), [64-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.6/endless-sky-win64-0.9.6.zip), and [32-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.6/endless-sky-win32-0.9.6.zip). Ubuntu Linux packages are available in a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~mzahniser/+archive/ubuntu/endless-sky), and a Debian Linux [package](https://mentors.debian.net/package/endless-sky) is also available. For more details, see the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/changelog).

Release 0.9.7 will be another "unstable" release, focusing on new content and game engine improvements. My plans are for that to include a revamp of the AI, including turrets that have limited turn rates and that track targets independently. I'm also hoping to put some time into creating better documentation for the code and the game data, to make it easier for new contributors to find their bearings.

I'll be on vacation for the next month, so don't panic if you notice that things aren't getting updated on GitHub.
