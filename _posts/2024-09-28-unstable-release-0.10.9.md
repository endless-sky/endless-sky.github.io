If you like more Endless Sky, boy do I have the thing for you! v0.10.9 is now live on Github and Steam! As usual, GoG will be within a few days pending some QA testing. This is a hefty unstable release that brings all sorts of content additions, adjustments, balance changes, bug fixes, and so on! If you're itching to know everything that has changed, head on over to the changelog for the release, which can be found here:

Here are some highlights coming with this release:

When it comes to boarding and capturing, there never really has been a reason to incorporate defense, as the game always calculates using the attack values of the AI versus your crew. With this update, if both sides choose to attack, two rounds of combat are run - one with the player's attack against the enemy's defense, and one with the enemy's attack against the player's defense, instead of using the player's attack against the enemy's attack. Now those thousands of Pug Biodefenses you farmed can be useful against any trigger-happy pirate, thanks to the efforts of Peter and Hurleveur. But that's not all that these two have for us!

Have you ever wanted your escorts to fly with you more uniformly? To enter a system in style, or to enter one with a more strategic lineup? Well, now you can, with the addition of Fleet Formations! Using Shift + your "fleet gather" key (G by default), you can now cycle through several fleet formations, such as circles, lines, daggers, and several other shapes! Once again thanks to Peter.

And if that isn't enough for you fleet-wise, we now have the long-requested Hold Fire command, which you can find in the Controls tab of the game's settings if you wish to change it to a different key. And once again, thanks to Hurleveur.

For the more meaty part of this update, we have not one, but once again, TWO new species that have appeared in the Endless Sky galaxy, each with their own territory to explore and a few interactions to be had. Be on the lookout for the Incipias authored by RisingLeaf, and the Successors from Daeridanii1! That's all I would like to say about them, however. If you want to peek over back to Gegno space, you might find a few new missions there too.

A few honorable mentions to wrap things up:

The Emerald Sword's Dragonflame Cannon now pierces through its target. Huzzah! From Zoura.
Wanderer worlds now have defense fleets, meaning they can now be conquered by you maniacs. From TheGiraffe3.
Governments no longer assist player escorts if the player doesn't know their language. "What did he say?" From TomGoodIdea.
Assisting/boarding ships are now able to recharge batteries. Nice! From tibetiroka.

Friendly reminder that in order to play unstable updates over on Steam or GoG, you have to opt into the beta branch.

For Steam, go to your library, right click Endless Sky, go to Properties, go to Betas, select the beta in the drop down box, and that's it! Also a reminder that we now have a GOG release, and you can find that here if you're interested.

With GOG, go to your library, right click Endless Sky, go to Manage Installation -> Configure, and select the beta in the Beta Channels drop down box.

Later in October, you can expect the next release, v0.10.10 Stable. This will be focused mainly on bugfixes for this unstable release. You won't have to opt into the beta branch once it is available.

And as always, if you would like to give us feedback on anything else in this update, or on the game in general, here is a link to our [feedback box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdl_fVDlVdGpvXgZ4ya7YmGK1FQx9fJ-9L25Xmm2_dG8wpUcQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)! Dig into the update for a bit and let us know your thoughts!

Remember to star us on Github if you haven't yet! The easier people can find the game, the more will come and enjoy it with the rest of us!
