It's that time again! The newest version of Endless Sky, v0.10.1, is now live on both Steam and GitHub. Check the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/v0.10.1/changelog) for a full list of changes.

This marks only three months (and a few extra days) since the last release. We're really starting to get into the groove of consistent updates, so it looks like we can finally say that the days of waiting over a year for new updates are behind us! Now, onto the usual showcasing of the major changes.
Last release I mentioned that a massive Hai storyline from @Gr√¶y, MasterOfGrey and others was in the works, and was actually visible within the game data files, but disabled from being accessed through normal means while it was still under construction. We've now made the first chapter of this storyline available as of this release! I won't spoil the details for you, so you're just going to need to jump in and find them out for yourself. More chapters of the storyline will be made available in future releases, and we hope to have the entire thing finished by the end of the year.

Note that the storyline takes place after the main campaign is completed, and you will need to wait 230 days after that (or upon starting a pilot with this update for the first time if you've already completed the main campaign) before the events of the storyline are set in motion, so take that time to enjoy some of the other new content and features from this update. 

This update has also brought with it a number of changes surrounding asteroid mining. Thanks to efforts by @samrocketman, your escorts are now able to more actively engage in mining, and we've added various quality of life features around mining to hopefully make it a more enjoyable experience. I'd explain in more detail, but part of these changes also involved adding tutorial dialogs for mining to the game, so I think it'd be better if you guys learned through those. If you're still not sure of everything new after going through the tutorials, then that's a sign that we need to improve them.

There have also been a number of improvements to settings and preferences, but perhaps the biggest change is the new ability to disable and enable plugins from within the game, without needing to go and move plugins that you no longer want active out of your plugins folder! You can thank @samrocketman and @quyykk for that one.
Note that at the moment you will still need to restart your game for the changes to take effect.

All that and so much more is available this release! The Gegno have been given new ships and outfits for each of their factions thanks to @Saugia*. Content creators can make use of various new mission creation tools in the form of NPC actions from myself and @warp_core, and the ability to format condition values and place them into conversations from UnorderedSigh. Thanks to @Koranir | Lost Code Herder, controls can now be unbound by pressing X or delete when hovering over a control, allowing you to more finely tune your control mappings as we continue to expand the number of controls available to the player. Oh yeah, and we might have also fixed an infinite money glitch, which is I think the first time we had to do that.

Friendly reminder that in order to play unstable updates on Steam you need to opt into the beta branch. To do that, go to your Steam library, right click Endless Sky, go to Properties, go to Betas, and select the beta in the drop down box. (You don't need any sort of beta code, just select beta in the drop down box and close the menu.)
The next release, v0.10.2, will be a stable release that focuses on bug fixes for these past two major releases. You will not need to opt into the beta branch on Steam when it is made available. The plan is to have this bug fix release finished by the end of June.
