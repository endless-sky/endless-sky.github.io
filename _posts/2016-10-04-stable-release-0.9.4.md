A new release is now available on GitHub, stable version 0.9.4. This version focuses on bug fixes and usability improvements. Downloads are available for [Mac OS X](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.4/endless-sky-macosx-0.9.4.dmg), [64-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.4/endless-sky-win64-0.9.4.zip), and [32-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.4/endless-sky-win32-0.9.4.zip). Ubuntu Linux packages are available in a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~mzahniser/+archive/ubuntu/endless-sky), and a Debian Linux [package](https://packages.debian.org/endless-sky) is also available. For more details, see the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/v0.9.4/changelog).

Release 0.9.5 will focus on larger changes, including new Wanderer plot and a new alien faction with its own territory and ships, some of which I've already got rough-draft graphics for:

Because 0.9.5 will include a lot of new content, it'll probably be 2 months or more before that release is published.
