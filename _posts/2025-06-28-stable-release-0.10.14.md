Summer's here and the heat is on (assuming you live in the northern hemisphere), so why not cool down inside and play the newest release of ES! Version 0.10.14 is now live! This is a stable release that goes out to everyone, so you don't need to opt into any beta branches to get it. The release mainly consists of bugfixes and minor adjustments following the previous major release. If you have yet to see what all came with that release, as it was a big one, check out the last post that details some of the major changes, or head on over to the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/changelog) on Github to see the full list.

There were some big changes to gameplay in the previous release such as experimental restock adjustments and tweaks to some FW battles; we'd still love to hear feedback on them or the game overall. If you haven't yet and are interested, head on over to the Feedback Box from last release.

You can find the Github discussion post here for this release. While you're over there, give us a star if you haven't yet! If you'd like, you could also review the game either over on our Steam or on our GOG. Doing so helps increase the game's discoverability so others can play find and play it.

v0.10.15, our next major release, is set to be released around late September. Enjoy the outdoors!
