v0.10.8 is now live on Github, Steam, and GOG!

This release is being sent out to everyone, so you don't need to be on the beta branch to get it. This update focuses on bug fixes for the recent v0.10.7 release, so if you haven't played that then take a look at the announcement above or the changelog to see what's new.

A reminder that we have a feedback form for each major release, the most recent one being [here](https://forms.gle/6A9kEcrFHSLw9CQw5). If you haven't looked at them already, it would help to check them out and leave us any feedback.

Also, if you haven't already, head over to Github and star Endless Sky or give us a positive review on Steam or GOG to help the game become more discoverable!

Our next unstable release, v0.10.9, is planned for late September. ðŸ‘€
