Stable release v0.10.16 is here, consisting of bugfixes and small additions and adjustments to the previous unstable release. As a stable release, it will be sent out to everyone, and you are not required to opt into any beta branches. Moving forward, you can also expect Flathub releases to be more consistent, with one coming in the next day or so. For a full list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/v0.10.16/changelog) on Github, where you can also see what came with the previous unstable, if you haven't yet!

Alongside the various changes, we've decided to revert the refactor to reverse thrust behavior following several bug reports and other feedback. Like we did with the hold fire command, we'll be looking at getting these changes in a more stable form before reintroducing them in a later update.

Speaking of feedback, feel free to visit and make a submission to the [Feedback Box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDrmpovaYtsEw-qgu2ZIclPJY1V5RBlYMvJx2bogJDI77zCA/viewform) from the previous release, whether it's about the release or the game overall. Alternatively (or additionally), you could submit reviews to our Steam page, or at our page on GOG. 

There's also a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions/11868) for this release. While you're there, don't forget that shiny star button on our front page that helps our game be more discoverable! Hit it if you haven't yet, it really helps us out!

We will see you again for our next major unstable release, v0.10.17, in late January.
