Hope you're all enjoying the fall season! Our stable release v0.10.10 is here! This contains mostly bug and typo fixes and tweaks for the previous v0.10.9 unstable release. You don't need to opt into any beta branches to get this release as it is sent out to everyone on Steam and GOG.

Along with various fixes, this release we've decided to revert the hold fire mechanic. Players have found bugs with it that affect gameplay negatively, so we've decided to put that one back in the oven until we can address them more adequately. For a list of all changes, take a look at the release on Github: https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases

We always like to hear your feedback, if it's about the current update or the game overall! You can still submit feedback to the feedback box from the previous release here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdl_fVDlVdGpvXgZ4ya7YmGK1FQx9fJ-9L25Xmm2_dG8wpUcQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

Our next unstable release, v0.10.11, will be later in January. See you then!
