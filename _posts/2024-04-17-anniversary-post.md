Hello everybody,

Today marks a monumental milestone: ten years ago the very first public release of Endless Sky—[version 0.7.9](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/tag/v0.7.9)—launched on GitHub.

With that anniversary upon us, we’d like to take a moment to reflect on what our passionate, talented and ever-growing community of players, contributors, and volunteers have accomplished over the past decade.

Here’s what ten years have brought to the universe of Endless Sky:
498 Star Systems
649 Unique Outfits
277 Distinct Ships
439 Planets to Discover
1,891 Missions to Complete
10 New Factions
215,619 Lines of Content
5,623 Images
316 Megabytes of Data

As we celebrate this anniversary we’d love to hear from you:
What’s been your favorite addition to Endless Sky over the past ten years?
Were you excited by one of the new factions?
Drawn in by a new mission?
Blown away by a new feature?
Or was it something else entirely?
Let us know in the comments below!

And to everyone who made those moments possible we offer a heartfelt thank-you.
To everyone who's played, provided feedback, and the over 348 people who have contributed to this project: whether your work was in code, artwork, writing, or anything else, you’ve helped turn Endless Sky into something truly special.

Here’s to the next ten years of adventure. We’re excited to keep exploring, expanding and pushing the boundaries of what an open-source game can be
