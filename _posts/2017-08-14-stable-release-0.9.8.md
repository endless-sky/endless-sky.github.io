A new release is now available on GitHub, stable version 0.9.8. This version focuses on fixing bugs and making small UI improvements. Downloads are available for [Mac OS X](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.8/endless-sky-macosx-0.9.8.dmg), [64-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.8/endless-sky-win64-0.9.8.zip), and [32-bit Windows](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.8/endless-sky-win32-0.9.8.zip). Ubuntu Linux packages are available in a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~mzahniser/+archive/ubuntu/endless-sky), and a Debian Linux [package](https://mentors.debian.net/package/endless-sky) is also available. For more details, see the [changelog](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/changelog).

As with all unstable releases, 0.9.9 will probably take at least 3-4 months to complete (especially because I'm about to go on vacation for a few weeks). My main goal for 0.9.9 is to finish the Wanderer story line, as well as to overhaul some sections of the code (like the AI) that are getting way too fragile and messy. That release will be followed by a 0.9.10 stable release; I'm saving the 1.0.0 number until, at the very least, the three main human story lines are implemented.
