<p>Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...</p>

<a id="header" class="anchor" href="#header" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6 Oct 2015: Updated stable release (v. 0.8.4)</h3>

<p>(This release fixes several bugs, and makes some small changes to the user interface, particularly the map views. If you are using the high DPI graphics plugin, the graphics have not changed since release 0.8.1, so you do not have to update it.)</p>

<p>Endless Sky is designed to make it as easy as possible for users to create their own content. An <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-editor/releases">editor</a> can be used to create new star systems and planets (or to replace the existing universe entirely), and the <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki">wiki</a> has instructions on how to create ships, missions, and artwork. You can also visit the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506977743">Steam greenlight</a> page for more screenshots and a video.</p>

<p>If you have a Github account, please report bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues">issue list</a>. If not, or if you want to suggest new features or discuss the game with others, visit the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/endless-sky">forum / mailing list</a> on Google Groups.</p>

<p>This is a stable release. The game is fully playable and feature-complete, and has gone through five months of beta testing. But, only one of the three main story lines (the "Free Worlds" story) is written. Playing through the story takes about 8-16 hours, but you can also ignore it and treat this like a sandbox game. See the <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual">player's manual</a> for more information, or go ahead and download:</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-high-dpi/releases/">high-dpi graphics plugin</a> is also available:</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/dpi.jpg" alt="High DPI graphics"></p>

<p>These graphics are used in place of the normal, lower-resolution ones if you have a high DPI monitor or a zoom factor set higher than 100%. The effect is most noticeable in the outfit thumbnails and the landscape photos. Using the high-DPI graphics will significantly increase the game's load time and memory requirements.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/trading.jpg" alt="The trading panel (available when you land on a planet)"></p>

<p>Early on in the game, you can earn a living just by buying commodities for a low price in one star system and selling them at a profit elsewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/map.jpg" alt="The galaxy map, with the current hyperspace route shown"></p>

<p>Finding trade routes, made easy: the map view shows commodity prices for other star systems and can color them based on price, to help you decide what trade goods you should buy in the current system for sale elsewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/plunder.jpg" alt="Boarding a disabled enemy ship"></p>

<p>The fast, risky road to riches: disabling pirate ships, boarding them, and stealing their cargo and equipment. If you have enough crew members to pilot both ships, you can also try to defeat the enemy ship's crew and capture it. Of course, you can also plunder innocent merchant ships if that's more your style...</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/missions.jpg" alt="The job board, where you can take on new missions"></p>

<p>The safer way to earn a living: taking jobs carrying cargo or passengers.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/outfitter.jpg" alt="The outfitter, where you can buy new equipment for your ship"></p>

<p>Once you've saved up enough money, you can spend it on upgrading your ship's equipment and weapons, or on a bigger ship.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/shipyards.jpg" alt="A map of which planets have shipyards selling a particular ship"></p>
<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/outfitters.jpg" alt="A map of which planets have outfitters selling a particular outfit"></p>

<p>New feature in version 0.7.11: rather than hunting around at random hoping to find a planet that sells the particular ship or outfit you want, the map can now show you a list of every ship or outfit you know about and where each one can be bought.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/editor.jpg" alt="The universe editor"></p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-editor">universe editor</a> to create new star systems and planets. Making new <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingShips">ships</a> or equipment is also designed to be easy, and can be done with any drawing program that can save PNGs. New content can be added through <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins">plugins</a> or by editing the game data itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/hyperspace.jpg" alt="A fleet of freighters (plus one warship escort) traveling via hyperspace"></p>

<p>A merchant fleet traveling via hyperspace. You can buy as many ships as you want, but the more freighters you have in your fleet, the more attractive it will be to pirates.</p>

<p>Strange discoveries await you beyond the boundaries of known space.</p>
